# 📱 Android Bootcamp Repository

Welcome to my Android Bootcamp GitHub repository!

This repo includes all the work I completed during my Android development course – from early exercises to my full-featured midterm project app.

## 📌 Repository Structure

> This repository uses **branches** to organize content:

- 📝 `homeworks` branch – All weekly Android assignments (UI basics, RecyclerView, Firebase setup, etc.)
- 🧩 `challenges` branch – Mini coding tasks to practice problem-solving and Android fundamentals
- 🚀 `midterm_project` branch – **ExploreIt App** – My tour-booking midterm project with full functionality

To view each section, simply switch branches from the dropdown above. 👆

## 🚀 Midterm Project – ExploreIt App

### ✨ Why I Built It
I created **ExploreIt** to help users explore and book travel tours more easily. The idea was to make an app where people can browse, filter, and book different tours – all in one place.

### 💡 Key Features
- **Browse Tours** – View a scrollable list of travel tours with details like name, location, price, and rating
- **Search** – Quickly search tours by title or location
- **Filters** – Sort by popular, cheapest, or longest tours
- **User Profile** – Personalized greeting using the logged-in user’s name
- **Booking System** – See tour details and book with a single tap

## 🤝 A Note for Reviewers

This repo showcases my **real work** from the bootcamp.  
I structured it into branches instead of separate repositories to keep things organized.  
If you're a recruiter or reviewer, feel free to explore each branch for a full picture of my learning and project-building journey.
